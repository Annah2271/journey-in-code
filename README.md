# Anna Simango – My Project World

Hi there, welcome to my little corner of the tech world.  
This repository is a **story of growth, curiosity, and creativity** that will grow more in future.  
Every folder here represents a step in my journey as a developer, designer, and problem-solver.

##  What You'll Find Inside

### Python Games
Playful projects where I turned logic into fun.  
Think of them as experiments in creativity, problem-solving, and making code *interactive*.

### Python Fun
Fun python exercises that contribute to my learning journey.  
They’re small, but they show how I build foundations brick by brick.

### Final Year Group Project
- **GitHub Link**: [Explore the Project](https://github.com/botsheloseitshiro/VolunterHub-ITPV302-Project.git)  
- **Video Preview**: A guided tour of the website we built as a team.  
This project taught me collaboration, persistence, and the art of aligning backend/frontend layers.The project was developed using **ASP.NET Core** for the backend and **React with Material UI** for the frontend. 

### Design Project
A Figma prototype where I explored **UI/UX design**.  
Because good code deserves good design — and users deserve clarity.

### Web Portfolio
My personal portfolio site, where I bring everything together in one professional showcase.

## Why This Repo Exists
I wanted recruiters and collaborators to have one simple link to explore my work.  
Instead of scattered files and half-hidden projects, this repo is a curated gallery of what I’ve built, learned, and loved creating.

## My Philosophy
- Code should be clear and maintainable.  
- Design should be human-centered.  
- Projects should show growth.  

I’m not just building software — I’m building experiences.
